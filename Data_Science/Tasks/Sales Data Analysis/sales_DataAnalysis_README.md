# Sales Data Analysis Project

## Overview
This project is a simple data analysis demonstration using Python. It generates synthetic sales data for a fictional company across different regions, product categories, and dates throughout the year 2022. The notebook includes data generation and a visualization of the correlation between key numerical variables (Sales, Profit, and Discount) using a heatmap.

## Features
- **Synthetic Data Generation**: Creates a dataset with 500 records containing columns for Date, Region, Product Category, Sales, Profit, and Discount.
- **Data Visualization**: Displays a correlation matrix heatmap to explore relationships between Sales, Profit, and Discount.

## Requirements
To run this notebook, you’ll need the following Python libraries installed:
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`

You can install these dependencies using pip:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
```

## Usage
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/sales-data-analysis.git
   cd sales-data-analysis
   ```

2. **Run the Notebook**:
   - Ensure you have Jupyter Notebook installed (`pip install notebook` if not).
   - Launch Jupyter Notebook:
     ```bash
     jupyter notebook
     ```
   - Open the `Sales_Data_Analysis.ipynb` file in your browser and run the cells sequentially.

3. **Expected Output**:
   - A Pandas DataFrame with 500 rows of synthetic sales data.
   - A heatmap visualizing the correlation between Sales, Profit, and Discount.

## Code Breakdown
- **Data Generation**: Uses `pandas` and `numpy` to create a synthetic dataset with random values for sales-related metrics.
- **Visualization**: Employs `seaborn` and `matplotlib` to generate a heatmap of the correlation matrix for numerical columns.

## Sample Output
The heatmap provides insights into how Sales, Profit, and Discount are related. For example, a high positive correlation between Sales and Profit would indicate that higher sales tend to lead to higher profits.
